# Nuclear vehicle mod for the game Factorio

[Factorio][] is a game about building factories, featuring elaborate
production networks, optimization and back-pressure.

This is just a fun little bit of code that uses Factorio's elegant modding
API to add support for nuclear-powered vehicles.  Currently, it includes a
nuclear tank.

You can download this from the built-in "Mods" menu, or check it out on the
[mod portal](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/emk/NuclearVehicles).

## Developer notes

The "nuclear-vehicle-steam-turbine" and "nuclear-vehicle-power" equipment
category are absolutely intended for use by other mods! And if there's
another vehicle mod out there with useful equipment that you think should
be supported, please feel free to let me know. Or send a PR!
